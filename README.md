### Hi, I'm Marcus üëã

I'm a **Developer Advocate** at [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com) where I help the community to build custom visualizations and integrations for [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) through plugins. 

Here are some other places you can find me on the internet:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcusolsson)
- [Website](https://marcus.se.net)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/marcusolsson1)

_Psst!_ If you'd like help with building plugins for [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), you can schedule a call with me on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/marcusolsson/plugin-development).

### Open source plugins for [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)

When I'm not helping others to build plugins I maintain a number of plugins myself. 

To see what I'm currently working on right now, check out my [plugin project board](https://github.com/users/marcusolsson/projects/1).
