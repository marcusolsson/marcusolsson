### Hi, I'm Marcus üëã

I'm a **Developer Advocate** at [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com) where I help the community to build custom visualizations and integrations for [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) through plugins. 

Here are some other places you can find me on the internet:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcusolsson)
- [Website](https://marcus.se.net)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/marcusolsson1)

_Psst!_ If you'd like help with building plugins for [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), you can schedule a call with me on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/marcusolsson/plugin-development).

### Open source plugins for [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)

When I'm not helping others to build plugins I maintain a number of plugins myself. 

To see what I'm currently working on right now, check out my [plugin project board](https://github.com/users/marcusolsson/projects/2).

### Obsidian

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for all my learning, planning, and general note-taking. Fortunately, you can also extend it to support even more use cases. Here are a few of the projects I've been working on:

- [Obsidian plugin docs](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-plugin-docs), the [unofficial guide for developing Obsidian plugins](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs).
- [Obsidian Vale](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-vale), an Obsidian plugin for [Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale).
- [Obsidian pipe tricks](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-pipe-tricks), an Obsidian plugin that adds support for [pipe tricks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pipe_trick) to Obsidian.
- [Creature](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-creature-theme), a minimal, dark-only theme for Obsidian.

### Other projects

- [json-schema-docs](https://github.com/marcusolsson/json-schema-docs), a command-line tool for generating Markdown from a JSON Schema.
- [dts-docs](https://github.com/marcusolsson/dts-docs), a command-line tool for generating Markdown from a .d.ts file.
- [Edith](https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith), an open source learning platform based on **Gatsby**.
- [Enough](https://github.com/marcusolsson/vscode-theme-enough), a minimalistic theme for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [Gophers](https://github.com/marcusolsson/gophers), free-to-use illustrations of the Go gopher.

### Archived projects

I have many ideas. Unfortunately, I'm not able to maintain them all. Here are a few projects that people have found useful, but that I'm no longer maintaining.

- [tui-go](https://github.com/marcusolsson/tui-go), a UI library for terminal applications, written in Go.
- [goddd](https://github.com/marcusolsson/goddd), a Go port of the sample application from the [Domain Driven Design book](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215).
