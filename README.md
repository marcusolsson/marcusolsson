### Obsidian

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for all my learning, planning, and general note-taking. Fortunately, you can also extend it to support even more use cases. Here are a few of the projects I've been working on:

- [Obsidian Vale](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-vale), an Obsidian plugin for [Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale).
- [Obsidian pipe tricks](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-pipe-tricks), an Obsidian plugin that adds support for [pipe tricks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pipe_trick) to Obsidian.
- [Creature](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-creature-theme), a minimal, dark-only theme for Obsidian.

### Other projects

- [json-schema-docs](https://github.com/marcusolsson/json-schema-docs), a command-line tool for generating Markdown from a JSON Schema.
- [dts-docs](https://github.com/marcusolsson/dts-docs), a command-line tool for generating Markdown from a .d.ts file.
- [Edith](https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith), an open source learning platform based on **Gatsby**.

### Archived projects

I have many ideas. Unfortunately, I'm not able to maintain them all. Here are a few projects that people have found useful, but that I'm no longer maintaining.

- [tui-go](https://github.com/marcusolsson/tui-go), a UI library for terminal applications, written in Go.
- [goddd](https://github.com/marcusolsson/goddd), a Go port of the sample application from the [Domain Driven Design book](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215).
